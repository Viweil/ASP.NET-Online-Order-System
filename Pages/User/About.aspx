        <h2>Company Background</h2>
        <p style="width:600px;line-height:20px; text-align:justify">The vision that marked New Era’s® growth in the 1920s and 1930s  proved to be alive and well in the early part of the new millennium.  
        The company’s globalization efforts continued with offices opening  up in Europe, Japan, and Australia within a two-year period.  
        In 2001, Chris Koch, who had been the company’s president since  1993, was named CEO.   
        After a long, courageous fight with cancer, David Koch passed away  in 2002. 
        The David C. Koch Regional Perfusion Cancer Therapy  Center at UPMC in Pittsburgh honors his memory by providing medical treatment and care for cancer patients.  
        In 2006, the company moved its corporate offices from Derby back  to downtown Buffalo where it all started 86 years earlier. </p>
